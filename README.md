## What and why?

Sometimes you need to put some secret files inside docker image.  
One example is CI that can use secret variables but can't use secret files
(hello [GitLab](gitlab.com)). 
With `docker-secret` you can protect such files with encryption.  

Idea is very simple:
1. Encrypt files with GPG, protect them with password and place inside docker
image.
2. At any time you can decrypt files from image with password and save to local
filesystem or use them in CI pipeline. All tools for encryption is built-in.

Files encrypted with default GPG symmetric cipher (AES-128 now). It is strong
enough (of course, if you are not going to play with NSA ðŸ˜‰). 

Resulting image based on [Alpine Linux](https://hub.docker.com/_/alpine/)
and very small (16MB, ~7MB compressed).

## Building image

**You must build this image with `--squash` option only!**

Otherwise intermediate layers will contain secret files. `./secret.sh` will do
it for you.  
Squashing is experimental feature for now (docker 17.06.0) so docker daemon
should be started with `--experimental=true` flag (building only).

1. git clone https://github.com/farwayer/docker-secret.git && cd docker-secret
2. Put secret files inside `secret/`
3. `./secret.sh -c pAssW0rd`

```sh
 ./secret.sh -c [-i image-name] [-p] pAssW0rd

  -c: create image
  -i: image name ('secret' is default)
  -p: push image
```

## Decrypting files

### To local filesystem.

`./secret.sh -d pAssW0rd`

```sh
  ./secret.sh -d [-i image-name] [-o out-secret] pAssW0rd

  -d: decrypt and get out secret files
  -i: image name ('secret' is default)
  -o: output dir ('dsecret' is default)
```

### Inside container

`decrypt ./decrypted/ pAssW0rd`

## Using with gitlab-ci

```yaml
stages:
  - secret
  - build
  - clean

secret:
  stage: secret
  image: registry.gitlab.com/secret-image
  variables:
    GIT_STRATEGY: none
  script:
    - decrypt keystore/ "$SECRET_PASSWORD"
  cache:
    policy: push
    paths:
      - keystore/release.jks

build:
  image: registry.gitlab.com/...
  stage: build
  cache:
    policy: pull
    paths:
      - keystore/release.jks
    ...

clean: # override cache after build to prevent save secret files
  image: busybox
  stage: clean
  when: always
  cache:
    policy: push
    paths:
      - empty
  script:
    - touch empty
```
